### Step 1: If the lengths of s and t are not equal, return false.
### Step 2: Create a way to count each character in both strings. I chose hashmaps(unordered_map) here.
### Step 3: For each character in both strings, update their counts in your hash maps.
>If you wanted to make this even faster, what could you do instead of building two hash maps?
>>Count in one hash map, add for one string, subtract for other
### Quick check:
>If you used this single hash map approach, what would you check at the end?:
>>All values are zero
