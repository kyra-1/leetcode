## 🧠 Thinking Process: Merge Two Sorted Arrays (LeetCode #88)

### 📘 Problem Statement Recap:

We are given two sorted arrays:

* `nums1` of size `m + n`, with first `m` elements valid and last `n` elements as placeholders (0s)
* `nums2` of size `n`

We need to **merge `nums2` into `nums1`** so that the final array is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, and we must do it **in-place**, using O(1) extra space.

---

### 🔍 Key Observations:

1. Since `nums1` has extra space at the end, we can utilize it from the **back** to avoid overwriting existing elements.
2. Merging from the **end** ensures we only compare and fill the largest elements first, and reduce the need to shift elements.
3. We maintain 3 pointers:

   * `i` at `m-1` (end of valid elements in `nums1`)
   * `j` at `n-1` (end of `nums2`)
   * `k` at `m+n-1` (end of full `nums1` buffer)

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes in Initial Attempts:

* Using both a `for` loop and an internal `while`, causing multiple pointer updates in one iteration.
* Trying to manually handle `if i < 0` and `if j < 0` inside the loop, which can cause index errors.
* Not realizing that leftover elements in `nums1` are already in correct order.

## ✅ Optimized & Clean C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int i = m - 1;        // Last index of valid elements in nums1
        int j = n - 1;        // Last index of nums2
        int k = m + n - 1;    // Last index of nums1's total size

        // Merge from back
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
            } else {
                nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
            }
        }

        // Copy remaining elements of nums2 (if any)
        while (j >= 0) {
            nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
        }
        // No need to copy nums1 leftovers: they're already in place
    }
};
```

---

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity:

* **Time:** O(m + n) — every element is touched once
* **Space:** O(1) — in-place merge

---

### 🧪 Edge Cases Handled:

* `n == 0`: `nums2` is empty → nothing to merge
* `m == 0`: `nums1` is all zeros → just copy `nums2`
* All elements in `nums2` smaller/larger than `nums1`
* Arrays with repeated elements

---

### 📌 Review Notes:

* Always merge **from the back** to avoid overwriting.
* Only copy `nums2` leftovers — never touch `nums1` leftovers.
* Avoid complex logic inside a `for` loop; simple `while` loops make tracking pointers easier.
* Prevent invalid access by checking bounds strictly (`i >= 0`, `j >= 0`).
