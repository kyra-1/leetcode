Thought Process:
1: First, check if haystack’s length < needle’s length. If yes, return -1
2: use a "sliding window"
For each position in haystack, compare the substring of length n (needle’s size) with needle.
> Try looping through haystack from index 0 to (haystack length - needle length). At each step, check if the substring starting at that index matches needle (compare haystack.substr(i, needle.length) with needle). If it matches, return the index.
